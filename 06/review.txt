Why is it  important to have a user confirm their password during the registration process?  Because the values being entered are not visible to the user, it is important to make certain that the password is what the user had intended.  It may also be valuable to use the trim() function to clear out any leading or trailing white space.

Without knowing anything about $var would the following conditional be true or false, why?
If ($var =  'donut')  { //this conditional is true because $var is being assigned the value of donut

What do these operators mean?  
( && ) - and, both sides of this operator must be true in order to evaluate to true
( || ) - or, one of the sides of this operator must be true in order to evaluate to true
( ! ) - not, this can be used to test against an argument

What is the syntax of a switch conditional?

	switch($var) {
		condition1:
			statement;
			break;

		default:

			break;
		}
		
When is a switch most commonly used?  In cases when if conditionals become too large and unruly.
