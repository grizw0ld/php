Let me put my poems in you
Sex on ice
Some people call me the painted man
We're gonna dance to one song, and one song only: "Lady Humps" by the Blackeyed Peas
I totally want to cut off your skin and wear it to my birthday... It's coming up... 
No exaggeration, I could not love a human baby more then I love this brush. 
Get out of my face!  I'll get inside your face
I see you still look like a fifteen year old girl, but not hot.
